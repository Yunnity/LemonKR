## Basic Idea of the Game

<p>You are given a 10x17 square grid, with each square containing an integer in the range [1, 9]  
Find 1xn row vectors, nx1 column vectors, or nxn matrices, where n is an  
arbitrary integer, for which all of the integers within that grouping sums to exactly 10.  
When a valid group is selected, all of the integers in said group will disappear and  
the player will be rewarded 1 point for each eliminated integer (some integers are  
encased within a lemon; eliminating these integers will result in +4 points instead).  
In the case that there are no more possible moves to make, the board will re-initialize  
with a new random 10x17 grid.
